  Graphs are used in are in all the fields where multiple components are
  connected. And there are several algorithms to optimize the query that we want
  to execute on the graph.

### Important Keywords

* **Vertices or Nodes** - A component
* **Edges** - Connection b/w two components
* **Adjacent vertices** - connected vertices
* **Order** - No of vertices
* **Size** - No of edges
* **DAG** - Directed acyclic graph

### Graph Representation

* **G = (V, E)**
* **Adjacency Matrix:**
  * Traversal is easy
  * &#x20;Becomes costly in the case of a sparse graph.
* **Adjacency List**
  * Node and edges
  * Good for sparse graph
  * Traversal can be made easy with the help of a map at each node representing a connection.
